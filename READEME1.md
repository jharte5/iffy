# Cabulator
    Cabulator is node application that tells you the cost of a taxi(cab) ride when the user inputs how far he/she is traveling and time of day.

## Motivation
    Traveling in NYC and the weather decides to rain on your parade? How about those cold winter nights after a night out with some friends/family and you live across town? Maybe another borough? Whats happens when your morning route on public transportation delayed? Need to know the price of a taxi ride from point A to point B? USE THE CABULATOR NODE APP! 

## How it Works
    User inputs the distance they need to travel as well as the time of day they need to travel.
    Formula `cost = ratePermile * miles + initial fare.`
